Demo site: http://52.11.70.134/

The site is built on 
Backend: node.js + socket.io + mongodb + handlebars.js(template)
Frontend: bootstrap + jquery + knockout.js

Session uses mongodb as session store, so the site can be expanded to multiple servers.

Before you run this site, please set up connection to mongodb in config/developement.js or production.js.
